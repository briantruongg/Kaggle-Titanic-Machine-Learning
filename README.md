# Kaggle-Titanic Machine Learning Competition

In this machine learning competition created by Kaggle, we explore the survivability of the famous Titanic sinking. Given the test and training data by Kaggle, we will predict the survival chance based on the data given (age, sex, passenger class, title, city embarked, etc)

An outline of the project/submission are as follows:

- data exploration

- analysis

- feature engineering

- modeling

- model evaluation and cross validation

- hyperparameter tuning

- submission
