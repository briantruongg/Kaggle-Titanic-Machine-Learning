# Kaggle-Titanic Machine Learning Competition

In this machine learning competition created by Kaggle, we explore the survivability rate of the famous Titanic sinking. Given the test and training data, we will predict the survival chance based on the data given (age, sex, passenger class, title, city embarked, etc)

An outline of the project/competition are as follows:
-data exploration
-analysis
-feature engineering
-modeling
